# ToolBelt
### DBC Final Project | 2016 Rock Doves

## Overview
The average use of a power tool over its life in US households is estimated to be less than 30 minutes. This means that many tool owners pay for tools that are only needed once, and that many people that need tools are left with the option to buy or rent from a hardware store.

Toolbelt is a mobile app that connects people that need power tools with tool owners in their neighborhood enabling a power-tool-sharing-economy.

## Team
The project team consists of:
* Afaan Naqvi
* Charlie Lee

## User Stories
